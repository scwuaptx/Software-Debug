Simplifying Problems
-
This homework is from the project 1 of the Zellar's book(http://www.whyprogramsfail.com/project1.php).

+ A. Description
	+ Given a failure input and the failed program, your task is to simply the failure input.

+ B. Requirement
	+ Please see the attached xmlproc-0.70a.zip. The program (from xmlproc-0.70a.zip) xmlproc/xpcmd.py will fail in xmlproc/demo/urls.xml
You are asked to generate the simplified failure-inducing input and document your work. The documentation should include at least the simplification processes in detail (how many times you have run to obtain the simplified input)

+ C. Steps
	1. Produce failure
	2. Write a testing function (test(), split(), and minus())
	3. Revise the ddmin module (python, c, or java)

##test.py
+ Generate the failure-inducing input

###How to use
```
python test.py inputfile.xml
```
